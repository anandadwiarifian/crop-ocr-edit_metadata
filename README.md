# Photo Processor: Crop, OCR, and Edit Metadata

A simple set of scripts to process my kid's preschool check-in/check-out photos by:
1. Cropping the images by defining the position and the crop size
2. Updating the photo metadata dates to match the actual dates shown in the photos

## Why?
I created this to properly organize photos from my kid's preschool app. Making sure they have the correct dates in their metadata for better accurate sequence in photo libraries.
